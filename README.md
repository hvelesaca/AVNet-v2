# AVNet: Cross-Spectral Attention-Vision Model for Camouflaged Object Detection in Ecological Conservation
This work introduced AVNet, a novel attention-vision architecture for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), optimized for ecological conservation. The proposed approach integrates an RGB-Thermal fusion approach with the Convolutional Block Attention Model (CBAM) within an encoder-decoder framework, enabling accurate detection of low-contrast and highly camouflaged targets. As an additional contribution, this study introduces the Bimodal Iguana Observational Set (BIOS), comprising 148 camouflaged RGB-Thermal registered image pairs, specifically collected to support COD research in wildlife conservation. Experimental results validate the model’s robustness under challenging real-world conditions. The original code and dataset presented in the study are openly available in GitHub at https://cod-espol.github.io/AVNet.
